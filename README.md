The goal of this project was to use time series analysis and regressive analysis in two separate jupyter notebooks to evaluate returns the Yen. In the first notebook, I use ARMA, ARIMA and GARCH modeling to evaluate the data. At the end, I evaluate the efficacy of said models and whether or not they merit consideration in business decsion making. Next, I take advantage of linear regression using lagged returns. Spoiler alert: this model is not trustworthy. See the conclusions section for further details.
